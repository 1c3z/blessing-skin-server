  introduction: |
    We use score system to prevent the behaviors like uplaoding huge amount of textures and registering players casually.
    Both adding players and uplaoding textures will consume your score. The score will be returned if you deleted them.
    Adding textures from skin library to your closet will not decline your score.

    The inital score of user on this site is :initial_score, you can acquire :score-from ~ :score-to scores by signing in.
